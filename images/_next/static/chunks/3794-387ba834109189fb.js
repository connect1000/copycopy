However, with the development of internet technology, trading centres have more and more control over data, and the equality of trading individuals and trading centres in many aspects, such as the equality of trading, the transparency of information, and the reliability of historical information, is becoming more and more unequal. At the same time, data monopolies and data closures between the various centralized trading platforms have made it impossible for centralized institutions to do the same. DeFi Mining was born out of this situation and seeks to solve many of the problems of the current generation of financial services through new technology.","p2":"As a \u201cnew generation of value transfer internet\u201d, blockchain finance is not only a traditional internet information transfer, but also a future value transfer network. The value flow of the new world will be the pioneer, builder, domainer and successor of the future. With Bitcoin and Ether breaking through the new highs in the past two years, the entire cryptocurrency market sentiment has also reached a high point, but from a microscopic perspective, the best performing pass-throughs in the DeFi space are only the leading projects in each segmentation track, and many investors who bought cryptocurrencies at high levels still have no hope of returning their capital. However, against this backdrop, some of those involved in liquidity mining have been able to earn high returns while preserving their capital, thanks to DeFi Mining, which uses an innovative structured risk-regulation mechanism and liquidity provisioning mechanism to attract additional investment from major chambers of commerce to provide pledged mining capacity for DeFi Mining crypto assets. Goal is to build a large ecology, i.e. to build a strong community and consensus before launching a product, i.e. a blockchain financial project, to enable users who already hold coins to sink in."},"2":{"title":"Mining has spawned a new industry chain","p1":"Secondly, mining as an infrastructure in the cryptocurrency world, it does not just exist in isolation. Cryptocurrency mining has evolved from CPU and GPU mining to ASIC mining, from individual mining to pool mining, and from no service at the beginning to perfect supporting services now. We can see through the whole evolution process of the mining industry that the cryptocurrency mining industry has spawned a new industrial chain around the development of the whole mining industry, from production equipment such as mining machines, mining farms and pools to logistics, accessories, finance and other supporting services have all emerged in response to the development of the mining industry and the rise in coin prices, thus enabling the entire mining industry to develop better."},"3":{"title":"The mining industry has huge room for development","p1":"The, as the cryptocurrency coin price continues to rise, its wealth effect will become more and more obvious, thus attracting more global users to actively participate. At the same time, it also drives the booming development of the entire cryptocurrency mining industry upstream and downstream. From the hosting of mining farms to the research and development of mining machines, from the technical optimization of mining pools to upgrading of logistics services, from the diversification of financial services to the introduction of new accessories, from the professional introduction of talents to the active layout of capital, all of them reflect the certainty and expansiveness of the future development of the entire mining industry."},"4":{"title":"Mining can effectively combat bull and bear market","p1":"The entire digital currency market experiences bulls and bears, peaks and troughs, and some industry participants, when experiencing industry bulls and bears, will choose between risk appetite and risk avoidance. And while mining sacrifices some liquidity relative to the high-risk, highly liquid digital currencies, its returns are also more long-term and stable."},"title":"Project Background Overview"},"2":{"1":{"title":"High investment requirement","p1":"At present, the mainstream mining form is still dominated by physical mining machines, which forces many users who want to mine to spend a certain amount of capital costs to buy a mining machine, after which they also need to build their own or find a suitable site for hosting, while the risk of the digital currency itself and the fluctuation of the coin price is relatively large. With so many uncertainties, users also need to pay a lot of capital and time costs in advance, thus raising the overall barrier to entry for the industry and discouraging many users."},"2":{"title":"Extensive knowledge required","p1":"Mining also has high professional requirements for miners, which involves two aspects: the professionalism of the hosting mine on the one hand, and the professionalism of the maintenance of the mining machines on the other. This is because a professional mining site has certain standards, whether it is the distance between machines or the ventilation and humidity of the site, which not only prolongs the life of the mining machines, but also allows them to run more stably. Maintenance specialisation requires professional maintenance staff who can deal with any problems that may arise with the mining machine, whether it is poisoning or hardware failure, thus guaranteeing that the mining machine is online 24/7."},"3":{"title":"Unregulated industry","p1":"As the current policy for mining and digital currency regulation is at a relatively early stage, legislation is lagging behind, and the overall development of the industry is in a state of barbaric growth, with a lack of unified standards, pre-sales and after-sales services, and varying levels of hosting, the industry is full of chaos, schemes and unspoken rules that give new and old miners headaches and even complaints."},"4":{"title":"Lackluster service","p1":"Mining is an industry with a large initial investment in fixed assets, and the financial services to match this are not perfect, resulting in poor liquidity of the fixed assets invested by miners. When miners need a certain amount of cash flow, they are stretched to the limit and have no way to liquidate their fixed assets in time to meet their financial needs, except for pledging and selling digital currencies. In addition to financial services, other services related to mining are also relatively backward, such as the construction and transfer of mining machine farms, the warranty and maintenance of mining machine parts, the reporting and publishing of mining information, etc., are all in a relatively rudimentary state."},"title":"Traditional mining problems"},"3":{"1":{"title":"Introduction to DeFi Mining","p1":"DeFi Mining is a global technology-leading {coin} arithmetic mining cloud service platform, and an international website dedicated to providing global users with safe, convenient, reliable and innovative digital asset derivatives.

It can freely deposit tokens for exchange and can be freely withdrawn. It does not trade with other trading users, it trades with a pool of tokens and has an automatic market making model to calculate the trading price.","p2":"One of the features of DeFi Mining is that it pools everyone\'s liquidity together and then makes a market based on an algorithm. The AMM model is supposed to be one of the biggest innovations of the current bull market, the cryptocurrency market. AMM fundamentally changes the way users trade cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional order book trading models, where both sides of the trade interact with an on-chain pool of liquid assets. The liquidity pool allows users to seamlessly switch between tokens on the chain in a fully decentralised, and uncustodied manner. The liquidity provider, in turn, earns passive income through transaction fees, which are based on the percentage of their contribution to the asset pool. What\'s more, your assets remain in your personally controlled wallet and not into the trading platform, so they remain 100% safe."},"point2":{"title":"Trading and exchange type services","p1":"DeFi Mining wallets have built-in digital asset trading functionality, from wallets with access to centralised exchange platforms, such as BitPie, to wallets with access to decentralised trading platforms, such as Imtoken, to automated trading platforms with access to the Bancor mechanism, such as Tokenpocket. Some wallets offer a \u201cflash exchange\u201d function, where different currencies are exchanged at a certain \u201cexchange rate\u201d, often using a centralised exchange model for the backend of the currency exchange. This not only reduces the number of steps users have to take to transfer coins to other coins, reducing the probability of making mistakes, but also enhances user stickiness and provides a good development direction and capital deposit for the subsequent transformation of the wallet project. However, the built-in exchange greatly increases the complexity of the system and introduces greater risk for wallet products that require high security themselves, and the security of user funds will be challenged to some extent."},"point3":{"title":"News and information services","p1":"DeFi Mining has a wealth of built-in digital asset market information such as news feeds, market snapshots, project profiles, K-line charts, large capital flow monitoring, code activity and more. Blockchain project information and quotes are what pass holders need to keep up with the market, and are also a great entry point for gathering user traffic. A well-integrated information and quotes service in a wallet product will not only create enough stickiness for existing users, but also bring in more incremental users. However, information services require a certain amount of investment in human and financial resources, which can significantly increase the operating costs of the product. Currently, most wallets do not have a well-developed news and information service, and mainly focus on providing quotes."},"point4":{"title":"Money Management Services","p1":"DeFi Mining has a built-in wealth management module, which includes long-term fixed income, short-term flexible balance, digital asset P2P_financing and lending, and mortgages. At present, some of these finance modules are connected to third party services and do not participate in finance services themselves; some are finance products developed to provide cheap funds for the development of their own platforms, with the platform\'s earnings paying interest to users; some are digital assets raised by the platform and then invested in primary or secondary market transactions to obtain excess returns and pay interest to users; and some provide P2P digital asset lending and borrowing transactions. Others offer P2P digital asset lending and trading services, providing a matchmaking service between those who demand and those who provide assets. For long-term coin holders, digital asset management services hit the nail on the head and can be held to gain income, with annual yields ranging from 4% to 20% for various types of wallets. However, the blockchain industry is developing rapidly and the digital asset market is volatile, so financial products with poor liquidity will face greater risks. The digital asset finance market is currently immature and no industry benchmark leading companies have emerged. In addition digital asset P2P lending type, if it is difficult to control the risk of the lender, it is easy to cause default, please pay attention to the risk of investors."},"point5":{"title":"POS mining services","p1":"For blockchain projects that support the POS consensus algorithm, some wallets offer a lock-in to join the POS mining service, and the mining proceeds will be sent to users on a regular basis. Usually the master node for POS mining is provided by the wallet project side. Digital assets that meet certain capital requirements can participate in POS mining, with fixed lock time mining and also a mining model that supports redemption at any time. The wallet project side will take a proportional share of the mining proceeds, and both the wallet project side and the user can have a more stable additional income. The coins that currently support POS mining are: DASH, Lite Bitcoin, zCoin, Qtum and Hcash."},"point6":{"title":"Asset aggregation services","p1":"Usually users will hold different coins in multiple exchanges and wallets, which is not very convenient for centralized management and revenue enquiries. Such wallets can provide users with fund aggregation services, aggregating users\' pass holdings in multiple wallets and exchanges through API interfaces, and platforms with poor support for API interface services can also use manual maintenance for initial input. Currently, the aggregation service can support exchanges, wallets, ICO funds and fiat funds.","p2":"Currently there are many different types of exchanges and wallets, each of which supports different types of digital assets, so users\' funds are usually scattered across different platforms, which is not conducive to centralised management and queries. This type of wallet requires API interface development with many exchanges and wallets, and there are certain development and maintenance costs."},"point7":{"title":"IDO One-Stop Platform","p1":"DeFi Mining will establish a one-stop platform for IDO project evaluation, promotion and access, DeFi Mining adopts a community governance model, DeFi Mining\'s voting weight is the only measure, holding DeFi Mining is recorded as one vote, pledging DeFi Mining is recorded as two votes, the DeFi Mining re-purchased or pledged after the voting starts is not counted in the voting results.

Cold wallets are suitable for wallets with large sums of money, where the public and private key pairs are generated offline and the user can generate any key pair they like. Hotwallets: Hotwallets are suitable for small and fast transaction scenarios. Hotwallet keys are hosted in a way that when a user registers for a wallet account, the private key generated using the user\'s payment password pair is encrypted locally on the user\'s computer via 3DES and the encryption results are hosted in the wallet cloud via the SSL protocol. This means that the hot wallet key information transmitted over the network and stored in the cloud is the user\'s encrypted data and no one other than the wallet user has access to the original content of the private key.","p2":"When a user needs to sign a transaction, the private key is obtained from the wallet cloud server and the content is decrypted on the user\'s local computer by the user entering the payment password, and upon successful decryption, the local wallet program will sign the transaction information with the private key and submit it to the DeFi Mining wallet network for trading. The DeFi Mining wallet also contains two types of assets - native assets and registered assets - similar in nature to real-life wallets that contain Chinese Yuan and various cards. Native assets can be used without any trust, while gateway-registered assets must trust the corresponding assets in order to exchange value.","p3":"Based on the above, and in order to better build the DeFi Mining wallet ecosystem, the DeFi Mining wallet introduces a series of key pairs, so that each wallet address corresponds to a key pair: a private key and a public key. The private key is a random number generator to generate a 256-bit entropy, displayed as a 64-bit hexadecimal number, which is unpredictable and unrepeatable, and therefore unique. It holds the ownership and control of the wallet and is used to sign and verify each transaction. In order to lower the user\'s threshold, the mnemonic becomes another manifestation of the plaintext private key. The DeFi Mining wallet, in order to help users to memorise complex private keys and increase convenience, generates a public key through a certain cryptographic algorithm (e.g. a hash function), which corresponds to the private key one by one. Its centralised wallet: a smart wallet for personal digital assets that supports the storage and transfer of a wide range of token transactions, will play a vital role in the next generation of the Internet digital economy. It can track and capture the data and market analysis of each exchange in real time, carry out intelligent arbitrage transactions in real time, determine the price difference of each trading platform and the trading volume of each currency to decide whether to carry out arbitrage tasks, and initiate transactions at the right time by itself, combined with a variety of arbitrage methods can be completely unaffected by price increases and decreases.

At the same time, data monopolies and data closures between the various centralized trading platforms have made it impossible for centralized institutions to do the same. DeFi Mining was born out of this situation and seeks to solve many of the problems of the current generation of financial services through new technology.","p2":"As a \u201cnew generation of value transfer internet\u201d, blockchain finance is not only a traditional internet information transfer, but also a future value transfer network. The value flow of the new world will be the pioneer, builder, domainer and successor of the future. With Bitcoin and Ether breaking through the new highs in the past two years, the entire cryptocurrency market sentiment has also reached a high point, but from a microscopic perspective, the best performing pass-throughs in the DeFi space are only the leading projects in each segmentation track, and many investors who bought cryptocurrencies at high levels still have no hope of returning their capital. However, against this backdrop, some of those involved in liquidity mining have been able to earn high returns while preserving their capital, thanks to DeFi Mining, which uses an innovative structured risk-regulation mechanism and liquidity provisioning mechanism to attract additional investment from major chambers of commerce to provide pledged mining capacity for DeFi Mining crypto assets. Goal is to build a large ecology, i.e. to build a strong community and consensus before launching a product, i.e. a blockchain financial project, to enable users who already hold coins to sink in."},"2":{"title":"Mining has spawned a new industry chain","p1":"Secondly, mining as an infrastructure in the cryptocurrency world, it does not just exist in isolation. Cryptocurrency mining has evolved from CPU and GPU mining to ASIC mining, from individual mining to pool mining, and from no service at the beginning to perfect supporting services now. We can see through the whole evolution process of the mining industry that the cryptocurrency mining industry has spawned a new industrial chain around the development of the whole mining industry, from production equipment such as mining machines, mining farms and pools to logistics, accessories, finance and other supporting services have all emerged in response to the development of the mining industry and the rise in coin prices, thus enabling the entire mining industry to develop better."},"3":{"title":"The mining industry has huge room for development","p1":"The, as the cryptocurrency coin price continues to rise, its wealth effect will become more and more obvious, thus attracting more global users to actively participate. At the same time, it also drives the booming development of the entire cryptocurrency mining industry upstream and downstream. From the hosting of mining farms to the research and development of mining machines, from the technical optimization of mining pools to upgrading of logistics services, from the diversification of financial services to the introduction of new accessories, from the professional introduction of talents to the active layout of capital, all of them reflect the certainty and expansiveness of the future development of the entire mining industry."},"4":{"title":"Mining can effectively combat bull and bear market","p1":"The entire digital currency market experiences bulls and bears, peaks and troughs, and some industry participants, when experiencing industry bulls and bears, will choose between risk appetite and risk avoidance. And while mining sacrifices some liquidity relative to the high-risk, highly liquid digital currencies, its returns are also more long-term and stable."},"title":"Project Background Overview"},"2":{"1":{"title":"High investment requirement","p1":"At present, the mainstream mining form is still dominated by physical mining machines, which forces many users who want to mine to spend a certain amount of capital costs to buy a mining machine, after which they also need to build their own or find a suitable site for hosting, while the risk of the digital currency itself and the fluctuation of the coin price is relatively large. With so many uncertainties, users also need to pay a lot of capital and time costs in advance, thus raising the overall barrier to entry for the industry and discouraging many users."},"2":{"title":"Extensive knowledge required","p1":"Mining also has high professional requirements for miners, which involves two aspects: the professionalism of the hosting mine on the one hand, and the professionalism of the maintenance of the mining machines on the other. This is because a professional mining site has certain standards, whether it is the distance between machines or the ventilation and humidity of the site, which not only prolongs the life of the mining machines, but also allows them to run more stably. Maintenance specialisation requires professional maintenance staff who can deal with any problems that may arise with the mining machine, whether it is poisoning or hardware failure, thus guaranteeing that the mining machine is online 24/7."},"3":{"title":"Unregulated industry","p1":"As the current policy for mining and digital currency regulation is at a relatively early stage, legislation is lagging behind, and the overall development of the industry is in a state of barbaric growth, with a lack of unified standards, pre-sales and after-sales services, and varying levels of hosting, the industry is full of chaos, schemes and unspoken rules that give new and old miners headaches and even complaints."},"4":{"title":"Lackluster service","p1":"Mining is an industry with a large initial investment in fixed assets, and the financial services to match this are not perfect, resulting in poor liquidity of the fixed assets invested by miners. When miners need a certain amount of cash flow, they are stretched to the limit and have no way to liquidate their fixed assets in time to meet their financial needs, except for pledging and selling digital currencies. In addition to financial services, other services related to mining are also relatively backward, such as the construction and transfer of mining machine farms, the warranty and maintenance of mining machine parts, the reporting and publishing of mining information, etc., are all in a relatively rudimentary state."},"title":"Traditional mining problems"},"3":{"1":{"title":"Introduction to DeFi Mining","p1":"DeFi Mining is a global technology-leading {coin} arithmetic mining cloud service platform, and an international website dedicated to providing global users with safe, convenient, reliable and innovative digital asset derivatives.

It can freely deposit tokens for exchange and can be freely withdrawn. It does not trade with other trading users, it trades with a pool of tokens and has an automatic market making model to calculate the trading price.","p2":"One of the features of DeFi Mining is that it pools everyone\'s liquidity together and then makes a market based on an algorithm. The AMM model is supposed to be one of the biggest innovations of the current bull market, the cryptocurrency market. AMM fundamentally changes the way users trade cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional order book trading models, where both sides of the trade interact with an on-chain pool of liquid assets. The liquidity pool allows users to seamlessly switch between tokens on the chain in a fully decentralised, and uncustodied manner. The liquidity provider, in turn, earns passive income through transaction fees, which are based on the percentage of their contribution to the asset pool. What\'s more, your assets remain in your personally controlled wallet and not into the trading platform, so they remain 100% safe."},"point2":{"title":"Trading and exchange type services","p1":"DeFi Mining wallets have built-in digital asset trading functionality, from wallets with access to centralised exchange platforms, such as BitPie, to wallets with access to decentralised trading platforms, such as Imtoken, to automated trading platforms with access to the Bancor mechanism, such as Tokenpocket. Some wallets offer a \u201cflash exchange\u201d function, where different currencies are exchanged at a certain \u201cexchange rate\u201d, often using a centralised exchange model for the backend of the currency exchange. This not only reduces the number of steps users have to take to transfer coins to other coins, reducing the probability of making mistakes, but also enhances user stickiness and provides a good development direction and capital deposit for the subsequent transformation of the wallet project. However, the built-in exchange greatly increases the complexity of the system and introduces greater risk for wallet products that require high security themselves, and the security of user funds will be challenged to some extent."},"point3":{"title":"News and information services","p1":"DeFi Mining has a wealth of built-in digital asset market information such as news feeds, market snapshots, project profiles, K-line charts, large capital flow monitoring, code activity and more. Blockchain project information and quotes are what pass holders need to keep up with the market, and are also a great entry point for gathering user traffic. A well-integrated information and quotes service in a wallet product will not only create enough stickiness for existing users, but also bring in more incremental users. However, information services require a certain amount of investment in human and financial resources, which can significantly increase the operating costs of the product. Currently, most wallets do not have a well-developed news and information service, and mainly focus on providing quotes."},"point4":{"title":"Money Management Services","p1":"DeFi Mining has a built-in wealth management module, which includes long-term fixed income, short-term flexible balance, digital asset P2P_financing and lending, and mortgages. At present, some of these finance modules are connected to third party services and do not participate in finance services themselves; some are finance products developed to provide cheap funds for the development of their own platforms, with the platform\'s earnings paying interest to users; some are digital assets raised by the platform and then invested in primary or secondary market transactions to obtain excess returns and pay interest to users; and some provide P2P digital asset lending and borrowing transactions. Others offer P2P digital asset lending and trading services, providing a matchmaking service between those who demand and those who provide assets. For long-term coin holders, digital asset management services hit the nail on the head and can be held to gain income, with annual yields ranging from 4% to 20% for various types of wallets. However, the blockchain industry is developing rapidly and the digital asset market is volatile, so financial products with poor liquidity will face greater risks. The digital asset finance market is currently immature and no industry benchmark leading companies have emerged. In addition digital asset P2P lending type, if it is difficult to control the risk of the lender, it is easy to cause default, please pay attention to the risk of investors."},"point5":{"title":"POS mining services","p1":"For blockchain projects that support the POS consensus algorithm, some wallets offer a lock-in to join the POS mining service, and the mining proceeds will be sent to users on a regular basis. Usually the master node for POS mining is provided by the wallet project side. Digital assets that meet certain capital requirements can participate in POS mining, with fixed lock time mining and also a mining model that supports redemption at any time. The wallet project side will take a proportional share of the mining proceeds, and both the wallet project side and the user can have a more stable additional income. The coins that currently support POS mining are: DASH, Lite Bitcoin, zCoin, Qtum and Hcash."},"point6":{"title":"Asset aggregation services","p1":"Usually users will hold different coins in multiple exchanges and wallets, which is not very convenient for centralized management and revenue enquiries. Such wallets can provide users with fund aggregation services, aggregating users\' pass holdings in multiple wallets and exchanges through API interfaces, and platforms with poor support for API interface services can also use manual maintenance for initial input. Currently, the aggregation service can support exchanges, wallets, ICO funds and fiat funds.","p2":"Currently there are many different types of exchanges and wallets, each of which supports different types of digital assets, so users\' funds are usually scattered across different platforms, which is not conducive to centralised management and queries. This type of wallet requires API interface development with many exchanges and wallets, and there are certain development and maintenance costs."},"point7":{"title":"IDO One-Stop Platform","p1":"DeFi Mining will establish a one-stop platform for IDO project evaluation, promotion and access, DeFi Mining adopts a community governance model, DeFi Mining\'s voting weight is the only measure, holding DeFi Mining is recorded as one vote, pledging DeFi Mining is recorded as two votes, the DeFi Mining re-purchased or pledged after the voting starts is not counted in the voting results.

Arithmetic services are the core and most fundamental business of DeFi Mining, and users can enjoy a wide range of arithmetic services through the platform. In the world of cryptocurrencies, apart from buying and selling cryptocurrencies through exchanges, the only way to mine cryptocurrencies is to have arithmetic power, so the value of arithmetic power is particularly important here. Once a platform user has arithmetic power, they can turn it into tangible revenue through arithmetic power. DeFi Mining users who use the platform to purchase arithmetic for mining services will see their daily earnings increase as the price of the cryptocurrency rises, and vice versa.","p2":"Therefore, DeFi Mining itself has the ability and demand to continuously extend its cooperation with external arithmetic power, and as the arithmetic power purchased by DeFi Mining and accessed by external parties continues to increase, the larger the scale, the more users will continue to increase."},"2":{"title":"Streaming Service","p1":"DeFi Mining\'s miners can transfer their fixed assets, such as mining machines and mining farms, through the platform under certain conditions within the platform and on the secondary market, thus increasing the liquidity of miners\' assets and allowing more idle arithmetic power to come into play, so that users who want to mine can participate in the process.

The difference is that the smart contract\'s private key is discarded when the contract is created, so no one can send the digital assets inside the smart contract after it is created, except for the consensus mechanism. For the lot\'s monitoring event-based up-chaining needs, i.e. the loT device holder sets the smart contract, data storage path and data accounting amount in advance, it can be broadcasted across the network as well as stored in digital records. In the event of a relevant abnormal event that is incorporated into the blockchain\'s supervision, DeFi Mining\'s smart contracts require mandatory, strong real-time and fully automated triggering.

Cold wallets are suitable for wallets with large sums of money, where the public and private key pairs are generated offline and the user can generate any key pair they like. Hotwallets: Hotwallets are suitable for small and fast transaction scenarios. Hotwallet keys are hosted in a way that when a user registers for a wallet account, the private key generated using the user\'s payment password pair is encrypted locally on the user\'s computer via 3DES and the encryption results are hosted in the wallet cloud via the SSL protocol. This means that the hot wallet key information transmitted over the network and stored in the cloud is the user\'s encrypted data and no one other than the wallet user has access to the original content of the private key.","p2":"When a user needs to sign a transaction, the private key is obtained from the wallet cloud server and the content is decrypted on the user\'s local computer by the user entering the payment password, and upon successful decryption, the local wallet program will sign the transaction information with the private key and submit it to the DeFi Mining wallet network for trading. The DeFi Mining wallet also contains two types of assets - native assets and registered assets - similar in nature to real-life wallets that contain Chinese Yuan and various cards. Native assets can be used without any trust, while gateway-registered assets must trust the corresponding assets in order to exchange value.","p3":"Based on the above, and in order to better build the DeFi Mining wallet ecosystem, the DeFi Mining wallet introduces a series of key pairs, so that each wallet address corresponds to a key pair: a private key and a public key. The private key is a random number generator to generate a 256-bit entropy, displayed as a 64-bit hexadecimal number, which is unpredictable and unrepeatable, and therefore unique. It holds the ownership and control of the wallet and is used to sign and verify each transaction. In order to lower the user\'s threshold, the mnemonic becomes another manifestation of the plaintext private key. The DeFi Mining wallet, in order to help users to memorise complex private keys and increase convenience, generates a public key through a certain cryptographic algorithm (e.g. a hash function), which corresponds to the private key one by one. Its centralised wallet: a smart wallet for personal digital assets that supports the storage and transfer of a wide range of token transactions, will play a vital role in the next generation of the Internet digital economy. It can track and capture the data and market analysis of each exchange in real time, carry out intelligent arbitrage transactions in real time, determine the price difference of each trading platform and the trading volume of each currency to decide whether to carry out arbitrage tasks, and initiate transactions at the right time by itself, combined with a variety of arbitrage methods can be completely unaffected by price increases and decreases.
